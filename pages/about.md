# About

This page is maintained by the members of [AudioLab, Univeristy of York](https://audiolab.york.ac.uk).
The main purpose of this library is to share high quality spatial audio materials with the community.
The selection of materials puts an emphasis on the use of Higher Order Ambisonics for the delivery of spatial music.
We also aim to share details on the production workflows used for the creation of the materials.
